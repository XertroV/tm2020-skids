# TrackMania 2020 Custom Skid Marks

## How to install
**NOTE: This will overwrite custom mods on maps.**

To change your skids follow these steps:
1. [Download](https://github.com/snixtho/tm2020-skids/releases/latest/download/Skids.zip) the ZIP file and extract the `Skids` folder.
2. Open the extracted `Skids` folder and open the folder for the skid mark you want.
3. Copy the `Skins` folder inside the chosen skids, and paste it into your `Documents/Trackmania` folder.
4. Enjoy!

You can repeat the process for changing skids, just replace the files in `Documents/Trackmania` for the new skids. You do not need to restart the game or reload the map, changing skids will show live ingame. However, if you remove the skids, you will need to restart your game first.

### Removing the custom skids
To remove the custom skid marks, either rename or remove the folder called `ModWork` in `Documents/Trackmania/Skins/Stadium`. You will need to restart the game, otherwise skid marks will appear solid black.
